				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> Hi, I'm Sarah. I come from a non-technical background (BA in Art History!) and I fell in love with product management. I'm taking a break from being a full-time PM at an LA software company to devote myself to learning new technical skills so that I can become a better PM.

			        <h3>Work Session 1</h3>
			        <p> HTML is a web development language that creates structure for web pages. HTML creates structure in such a way that a human reading HTML code can visually see the structure or a browser interacting with the code can easily interpret it. HTML accomplishes this by breaking content down into components, and then those components are further broken down into their sub-components. This model of division and classification is visually represented for humans in the HTML code's tree-like structure, and it is also represented visually by boxes around content dispalyed by the browser. This model of classification is has <em>technologial empathy</em> becuase its systematic organization helps browsers to interact with it. How all of that works, I'm not sure at all!

			          <h3>Work Session 2</h3>
			          <p>CSS is a web development language that applies style to web pages. CSS, cascading style sheets, applies style rules to HTML elements. Often a single element will have many style rules apply to it. The style rule that is the most specitic to the element "wins" and that is the style that the browswer ultimately applies.</p>
			          <p>Like HTML, CSS relies on "boxifying" elements on a page. With CSS you can manipulate the size and position of these boxes to suite your design.</p>
